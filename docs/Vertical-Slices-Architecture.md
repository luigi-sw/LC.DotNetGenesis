### ðŸ“š Vertical Slices Architecture

#### Project Structure Overview
```cpp
MyVerticalApp/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Api/                      // ASP.NET Core API (Startup, Program, middleware, endpoints)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Features/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ FeatureN/             // Command + Handler + Endpoint in a single file or folder
â”‚   â”‚      â”œâ”€â”€ CreateFeatureN.cs    
â”‚   â”‚      â””â”€â”€ GetFeatureN.cs    
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Domain/                   // Shared domain objects (entities, value objects, enums)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Infrastructure/           // Persistence, external services, integrations
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Common/                   // Base classes, shared interfaces, helpers, response wrappers
â”œâ”€â”€ tests/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ UnitTests/                // Tests per vertical slice (e.g., Features/Orders/CreateOrderTests.cs)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ IntegrationTests/         // API tests, DB-backed tests for slices
â””â”€â”€ docs/                         // Architectural decisions, slice design guide, patterns
```

ðŸ”‘ Key Concepts
Features are organized by vertical slices (not by layers like Controllers/Services/Repos).
Each slice contains everything it needs: request model, handler, endpoint, validation.
Encourages high cohesion and low coupling â€” changes are localized to a slice.
Scales well with CQRS (Command/Query separation) and MediatR.
Reduces ceremony: minimal controllers, fewer cross-cutting concerns.
Can coexist with DDD and Onion/Clean principles internally, but slice is the unit of organization.

ðŸ“¦ Ideal Use Cases
Microservices or small/medium monoliths that require high modularity.
Systems where bounded features evolve independently.
Teams practicing feature-first development.
